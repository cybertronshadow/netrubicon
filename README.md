# netrubicon
This is netrubicon system. An advance IDS system 
NetRubicon has three systems. Packets collection and analysis mechanism, IDS alert process mechanism and the system will be used to perform basic network penetration testing. Since most of the available IDS determine if the packet is good or bad depending on the source port destination port source ip address and the destination ip address the proposed system will advance and look into TCP information like sequence number, acknowledgement, window flag and checksum.
